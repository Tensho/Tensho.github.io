Due to the intervention of Russia on the territory of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, I was left without a home. The city of Irpin and my dream of a quiet life were completely destroyed by bastards from the totalitarian country. The lives of my family members, relatives and friends are safe. But we will all have to recover from losses for a very long time and try to survive on the devastated land. In this regard, I can hardly write more on this blog.

Слава Україні!
